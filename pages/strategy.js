      <h3>Future You: "We know exactly what to do and where to start to implement our ideas."</h3>
      <h3>How do you get from where you are, to where you want to be?</h3>
      <p>The strategy phase is about understanding your goals and coming up with a plan to execute on them. Get a new perspective on the same problems you seem to be running into again and again. Layout your project, map unknowns and identify actionable next steps to take and get started.</p>
